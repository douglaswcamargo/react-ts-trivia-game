#### Overview

This project was developed using:
- `React`/`Typescript`

To manage the state, I've chosen to use `Redux` + `Saga`.

It uses `i18n` for localization management -- there is an example toggle at the top of the app page, but in a real application it would possibly be implemented differently (and there's also the backend that would require to be translated accordingly).

I've decided to use `styled-components` and it leverages the lib's theming -- there's also a simple "dark mode" switch example at the top of the page for demonstration purposes.

I've done some basic testing on the components, but there's room for more...
